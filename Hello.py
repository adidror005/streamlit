This could be due to concerns raised during the calls about the growth rate of EVs in the fourth quarter not meeting expectations, potential inventory issues related to silicon carbide, and specific softness in demand from one customer in the silicon carbide segment. These factors discussed in the earnings calls may have raised uncertainties among investors, leading to a potential negative impact on the stock price."

        Panasonic Holdings, a major supplier of batteries to Tesla, reported a reduction in automotive battery production in Japan for the September quarter. As a result, the company has lowered its annual profit forecast for the division by 15%. This adjustment reflects a broader global slowdown in electric vehicle (EV) sales. Other automakers and suppliers have also issued cautious outlooks, mirroring weaker growth in key economies like China and Europe.
        Panasonic's reduced battery production and profit forecast could negatively impact Tesla's stock price due to potential supply chain disruptions and market sentiment towards the EV sector.
